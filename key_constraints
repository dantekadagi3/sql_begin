here is a brief explanation of foreign key constraints i use in my databases

### Foreign Key Constraints with Cascading Actions üîÑ

When defining a foreign key constraint in MySQL, you can specify actions to be taken when a referenced row in the parent table is updated or deleted. These actions ensure data integrity and maintain relationships between related tables. 

#### ON UPDATE CASCADE üîÑ

The `ON UPDATE CASCADE` clause specifies that if a referenced row in the parent table is updated, the change will be cascaded to the corresponding rows in the child table. It's like a ripple effect, propagating updates across the database.

Example: If the `donor_id` of a donor in the `donor_info` table is modified, all corresponding `donor_id` values in the `recepient_info` table will be automatically updated to reflect the change.

#### ON DELETE CASCADE ‚ùå

The `ON DELETE CASCADE` clause specifies that if a referenced row in the parent table is deleted, all corresponding rows in the child table will also be deleted automatically. It's like a chain reaction, ensuring data consistency.

Example: If a donor's record is deleted from the `donor_info` table, all related records in the `recepient_info` table (where `donor_id` matches) will be automatically deleted to maintain referential integrity.

These cascading actions are essential for maintaining data consistency and integrity, especially in complex database schemas with interrelated tables.
